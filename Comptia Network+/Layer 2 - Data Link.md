The data link layer (layer 2) is responsible for transferring data between nodes on the same logical segment. At the Data Link layer, a segment is one where all nodes can send traffic to one another using hardware addresses.
Relatively few networks are based on directly connecting hosts together. Rather than making hosts establish direct links with one another, each host is connected to a central node, such as a switch or a wireless access point.
The data link layer organizes the stream of bits arriving from the physical layer into structured units called frames. Each frame contains a network layer packet as its payload. The data link layer adds control information to the payload in the form of header fields. These fields include source and destination hardware addresses, plus a basic error check to test if the frame was received intact.
