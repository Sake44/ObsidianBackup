The network layer (layer 3) is responsible for moving data around a network of networks, known as an internetwork or the Internet. While the data link layer is capable of forwarding data by using hardware addresses within a single segment, the network layer moves information around an internetwork by using logical network and host IDs.
The main appliance working at layer 3 is **router**.

The packet is forwarded, router by router (or hop by hop), through the internetwork to the target
network.
It is usually important for traffic passing between networks to be filtered. A basic firewall operates at layer 3 to enforce an access control list (ACL). A network ACL is a list of the addresses and types of traffic that are permitted or blocked.
