# Introduction
The OSI model breaks the data communication process into discrete layers.

## Open System Interconnection Model
A network is **two or more computer** systems that are linked by a transmission medium and share one or more protocols that enable them to exchange data. You can think of any network in terms of nodes and links. The nodes are devices that send, receive, and forward data and the links are the communications pathways between them.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model to promote understanding of how components in a network system works. It does this by separating the function of hardware and software components to seven discrete layers.

The OSI model is not a standard or a specification; it serves as a functional guideline for designing network protocols, software, and appliances and for troubleshooting networks.

## Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation

A network protocol is a set of rules for exchanging data in a structured format.
A network protocol has two principal functions:
