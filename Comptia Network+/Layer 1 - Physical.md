The physical layer (PHY) of the OSI model (layer 1) is responsible for the transmission and receipt of the signals that represent bits of data from one node to another node.
Different types of transmission media can be classified as cabled or wireless:
- Cabled: A physical signal conductor is provided between two nodes. Can also be called **bounded media**
- Wireless: Uses free space between nodes. Also called **unbounded media**.
The physical layer specifies the following: 
- Physical topology: The layout of nodes and links as established by the transmission media. An area of a larger network is called a segment. A network is typically divided into segments to cope with the physical restrictions of the network media used, to improve performance, or to improve security.
- Physical Interace: Mechanical specifications for the network medium, such as cable specifications, the medium connector and pin-out details.
Devices that operate at the Physical Layer:
- Transceiver: The part of a network interface that sends and receives signals over the network media.
- Repeater: A device that amplifies an electronic signal to extend the maximum allowable distance for a media type.
- Hub: a multiport repeater, deployed as the central point of connection nodes.
- Media converter: a device that converts one media signaling type to another.
- Modem: A device that performs some type of signal modulation and demodulation.
