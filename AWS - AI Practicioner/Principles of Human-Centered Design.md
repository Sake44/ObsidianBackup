Human-centered design (HCD) is an approach to creating products and services that are intuitive, easy to use, and meet the needs of the people who will be using them. When applied to explainable AI, HCD helps ensure that the explanations and interfaces provided are clear, understandable, and useful to the people they are intended to serve. This includes being accurate and fair.

The following are key principles of human-centered design for explainable AI:Â 

- Design for amplified decision-making.
- Design for unbiased decision-making.
- Design for human and AI learning.

#### Design for amplified decision-making
The principle of design for amplified decision-making supports decision-makers in high-stakes situations. This principle seeks to maximize the benefits of using technology while minimizing potential risks and errors. 

By designing for amplified decision-making, you can help to mitigate sensitive errors. Some key aspects of design for amplified decision-making include designing for clarity, simplicity, usability, reflexivity, and accountability.

#### Design for unbiased decision-making
The design for unbiased decision-making principle and practices aim to ensure that the design of decision-making processes, systems, and tools is free from biases that can influence the outcomes.
Design for unbiased decision-making involves the following steps:

- Identify and assess potential biases.
- Design decision-making processes and tools that are transparent and fair.
- Train decision-makers to recognize and mitigate biases.
Some of the key aspects to incorporate for designing for unbiased decision-making include transparency, fairness, and training.

#### Design for human and AI learning
Design for human and AI learning is a process that aims to create learning environments and tools that are beneficial and effective for both humans and AI.
Some of the key aspects to incorporate for designing for human and AI learning include cognitive apprenticeship, personalization, and user-centered design.
