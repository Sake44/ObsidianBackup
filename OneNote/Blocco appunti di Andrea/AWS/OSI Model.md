**TCP/IP model**  
The TCP/IP Model uses four layers that logically match the equivalent of the top six layers of the OSI reference model. It is also commonly referred to as the internet protocol suite.

==  
Link
====Defines the networking methods within the scope of the local network link on which hosts communicate without intervening routers.== ==Media Access Control (MAC) addresses==
==Internet== ==Has the responsibility of sending packets across network boundaries. Establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange.==  ==Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)==
==Transport== ==Establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange.== ==Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)==
==Application== ==Provides end user service, like exchanging application data over the network connections established by the lower level protocols.== ==Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)==

**TCP/IP Network model compared to the OSI model**
 
==The TCP/IP model and the OSI model are the most used communication networking protocols. The main difference between the two models is that OSI is a conceptual model. It== ==defines== ==how applications can communicate over a network. TCP/IP, on the other hand, is used to== ==describe how the TCP and IP protocols establish links and interact on a network.==
