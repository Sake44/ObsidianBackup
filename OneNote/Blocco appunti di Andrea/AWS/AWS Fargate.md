**AWS Fargate scales and manages the infrastructure, so developers can work on what they do best, application development.**
 
With Fargate, you can use all the same Amazon ECS concepts, APIs, and AWS integrations. It natively integrates with IAM and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With native integration with Amazon VPC, you can launch Fargate containers inside your network and control connectivity to your applications.
