Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a set-and-forget file system that automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files. There is no need for provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance. Amazon EFS can be used with AWS compute services and on-premises resources. You can connect tens, hundreds, and even thousands of compute instances to an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, and Amazon EFS can provide consistent performance to each compute instance.
