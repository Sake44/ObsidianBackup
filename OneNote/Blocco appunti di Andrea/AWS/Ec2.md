Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. With this service, you can provision virtual servers called EC2 instances.

When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is which operating system you want by selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

**Amazon EC2 instance types**  
EC2 instances are a combination of virtual processors (vCPUs), memory, network, and, in some cases, instance storage and graphics processing units (GPUs). When you create an EC2 instance, you need to choose how much you need of each of these components.
