# Introduction

In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that allows for multiple inputs to be connected to a single output. Thus, a terminal multiplexer gives us the ability to switch between different inputs as required. Although not exactly the same, screen and tmux share a series of common features:

• Any successful invocation will result in at least a session which — in turn — will include at least a window. Windows contain programs.
• Windows can be split into regions or panes — which can aid in productivity when working with various programs simultaneously.
• Ease of control: to run most commands, they use a key combination — the so-called command
prefix or command key — followed by another character.
• Sessions can be detached from their current terminal (that is, programs are sent to the
background and continue to run). This guarantees complete execution of programs no matter if
we accidentally close a terminal, experience an occasional terminal freeze or even remote
connection loss.
• Socket connection.
• Copy mode.
• They are highly customizable.
