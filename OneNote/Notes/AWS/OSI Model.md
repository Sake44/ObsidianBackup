The OSI model contains 7 layers: physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentations layer, and application layer. These 7 layers are the networking stack, which is the software that completes each function.
Then OSI model can further be grouped as Host layers and Media layers. The Media layer consists of layer 1 to layer 3. These layers define how our data moves between point A and point B.
The Host layer consists of the layer 4 to layer 7. These host layers are where your data is broken up for transport and then reassembled when it reaches the destination.

## OSI Model
The open system interconnection (OSI) model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a model for a computer communications architecture and as a framework for developing protocol standards.
## TCP/IP Model
[Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. The OSI model is a logical model and it was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. The TCP/IP model was designed for standard protocols and is a subsection of the OSI model. It combines the seven layers of the OSI model into four layers.

**TCP/IP Network model compared to the OSI model**
 

The TCP/IP model and the OSI model are the most used communication networking protocols. The main difference between the two models is that OSI is a conceptual model. It defines how applications can communicate over a network. TCP/IP, on the other hand, is used to describe how the TCP and IP protocols establish links and interact on a network.
