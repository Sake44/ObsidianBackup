AWS storage services are grouped into three categories: file storage, block storage, and object storage. In file storage, data is stored as files in a hierarchy. In block storage, data is stored in fixed-size blocks. And in object storage, data is stored as objects in buckets.

Files are organized in a tree-like hierarchy that consist of folders and subfolders.
 
**Use** **cases** **for file storage:**
 
**Web serving**
 
Cloud file storage solutions follow common file-level protocols, file naming conventions, and permissions that developers are familiar with. Therefore, file storage can be integrated into web applications.
 
**Analytics**
 
Many analytics workloads interact with data through a file interface and rely on features such as file lock or writing to portions of a file. Cloud-based file storage supports common file-level protocols and has the ability to scale capacity and performance. Therefore, file storage can be conveniently integrated into analytics workflows.
 
**Media and entertainment**
 
Many businesses use a hybrid cloud deployment and need standardized access using file system protocols (NFS or SMB) or concurrent protocol access. Cloud file storage follows existing file system semantics. Therefore, storage of rich media content for processing and collaboration can be integrated for content production, digital supply chains, media streaming, broadcast playout, analytics, and archive.
 
**Home directories**
 
Businesses wanting to take advantage of the scalability and cost benefits of the cloud are extending access to home directories for many of their users. Cloud file storage systems adhere to common file-level protocols and standard permissions models. Therefore, customers can lift and shift applications that need this capability to the cloud.

**Block storage**  
File storage treats files as a singular unit, but block storage splits files into fixed-size chunks of data called blocks that have their own addresses. Each block is an individual piece of data storage. Because each block is addressable, blocks can be retrieved efficiently. Think of block storage as a more direct route to access the data.
 
If you want to change one character in a file, you just change the block, or the piece of the file, that contains the character. This ease of access is why block storage solutions are fast and use less bandwidth.
 
**Use cases for block storage**  
Because block storage is optimized for low-latency operations, it is a preferred storage choice for high-performance enterprise workloads and transactional, mission-critical, and I/O-intensive applications.
 
**Transactional workloads**
 
Organizations that process time-sensitive and mission-critical transactions store such workloads into a low-latency, high-capacity, and fault-tolerant database. Block storage allows developers to set up a robust, scalable, and highly efficient transactional database. Because each block is a self-contained unit, the database performs optimally, even when the stored data grows.
 
**Containers**
 
Developers use block storage to store containerized applications on the cloud. Containers are software packages that contain the application and its resource files for deployment in any computing environment. Like containers, block storage is equally flexible, scalable, and efficient. With block storage, developers can migrate the containers seamlessly between servers, locations, and operating environments.
 
**Virtual machines**
 
Block storage supports popular virtual machine (VM) hypervisors. Users can install the operating system, file system, and other computing resources on a block storage volume. They do so by formatting the block storage volume and turning it into a VM file system. So they can readily increase or decrease the virtual drive size and transfer the virtualized storage from one host to another.

**Object storage**  
In object storage, files are stored as objects. Objects, much like files, are treated as a single, distinct unit of data when stored. However, unlike file storage, these objects are stored in a bucket using a flat structure, meaning there are no folders, directories, or complex hierarchies. Each object contains a unique identifier. This identifier, along with any additional metadata, is bundled with the data and stored.
 
Changing just one character in an object is more difficult than with block storage. When you want to change one character in an object, the entire object must be updated.
 
**Use cases for object storage**
 
With object storage, you can store almost any type of data, and there is no limit to the number of objects stored, which makes it readily scalable. Object storage is generally useful when storing large or unstructured data sets.
 
**Data archiving**
 
Cloud object storage is excellent for long-term data retention. You can cost-effectively archive large amounts of rich media content and retain mandated regulatory data for extended periods of time. You can also use cloud object storage to replace on-premises tape and disk archive infrastructure. This storage solution provides enhanced data durability, immediate retrieval times, better security and compliance, and greater data accessibility.Â 
 
**Backup and recovery**
 
You can configure object storage systems to replicate content so that if a physical device fails, duplicate object storage devices become available. This ensures that your systems and applications continue to run without interruption. You can also replicate data across multiple data centers and geographical regions.

**Rich media**
 
With object storage, you can accelerate applications and reduce the cost of storing rich media files such as videos, digital images, and music. By using storage classes and replication features, you can create cost-effective, globally replicated architecture to deliver media to distributed users.
