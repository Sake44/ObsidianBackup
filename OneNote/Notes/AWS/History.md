To be ready for this certification we need few things:
 
1. Use the AWS Well-Architected Tool: [https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/well-architectedtool/](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/well-architectedtool/)  
2. Complete AWS security workshops: [https://awssecworkshops.com/](https://awssecworkshops.com/)  
3. Simulating test: [Simulate testing](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Sample-Questions.pdf)  
4. Browse the AWS Architecture Center: _The AWS Architecture Center_([Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/)) has many examples of how to deploy reference architecture for analytics, compute and HPC deployments, and databases, to name just a few.
 
**History**
 
If you haven’t heard of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a  
branch of the U.S. government, you’re not alone. Around 2010, NIST began documenting  
the emerging public cloud. After consulting the major cloud vendors, it released  
an initial report in June 2011, Special Publication 800-145, “The NIST Definition of  
Cloud Computing”
 
Below the essential NIST's characteristics
 
1. **On-demand Self-Service:** _At AWS, a virtual server can be ordered and operational in under 5 minutes._
2. **Broad Network Access:** At AWS, applications and services can be made publicly available, or they can remain completely private. Virtual private network (VPN) connections from your place of work to AWS are commonplace. Customers can also order an AWS Direct Connect connection, a private fiber connection to AWS resources running at speeds up to 100 Gbps. Depending on the type of application you’re hosting in the AWS cloud, high-speed network access may be essential.
3. **Resource Pooling:** Without a massive pool of compute resources, AWS would not be able to allow customers to dynamically allocate compute resources to match their performance requirements workloads.
4. **Rapid Elasticity:** At AWS, compute and storage resources are defined as elastic. Workloads running in the AWS cloud for Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) deployments have the capability to automatically scale using a scaling policy to dynamically resize an Auto Scaling group of web or application servers using several scaling policies, including
5. **Measured Service:** You pay for what you use. The management of cost is one of the most important task to understand and control.
