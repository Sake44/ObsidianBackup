**Migration Strategies**  
A _migration strategy_ is the approach used to migrate a workload into the AWS Cloud. There are seven migration strategies for moving applications to the cloud, known as the _7 Rs_:

- [Retire](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html#retire)
- [Retain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html#retain)
- [Rehost](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html#rehost)
- [Relocate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html#relocate)
- [Repurchase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html#repurchase)
- [Replatform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html#replatform)
- [Refactor or re-architect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html#refactor)

Common strategies for large migrations include rehost, replatform, relocate, and retire. Refactor is not recommended for large migrations because it involves modernizing the application during the migration. This is the most complex of the migration strategies, and it can be complicated to manage for a large number of applications. Instead, we recommend rehosting, relocating, or replatforming the application and then modernizing the application after the migration is complete.
