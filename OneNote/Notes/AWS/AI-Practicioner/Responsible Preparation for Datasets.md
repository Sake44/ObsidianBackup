An essential requirement of responsible AI is to prepare your datasets responsibly. This means that you need to have balanced datasets to train your models. 

Remember that you can use **SageMaker AI Clarify** and **SageMaker Data Wrangler** to help balance your datasets.

### Balancing datasets
Balanced datasets are important for creating responsible AI models that do not unfairly discriminate or exhibit unwanted biases. 

Balanced datasets should represent all groups of people or data topics. This means that the dataset should contain an adequate number of examples or instances of each group to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular group or factor.

### Inclusive and diverse data collection
Inclusiveness and diversity in data collection ensure that data collection processes are fair and unbiased. Data collection should accurately reflect the diverse perspectives and experiences required for the use case of the AI system.
Example: if an ML model is trained primarily on data from middle-aged individuals, it might be less accurate when making predictions involving younger and older people. Therefore, the datasets should be collected so that age groups are equally represented.

### Data Curation
The second part of balancing the datasets involves curation of the datasets. Curating datasets is the process of labeling, organizing, and preprocessing the data so that it can perform accurately on the model.
The main steps of curating data include data preprocessing, data augmentation, and regular auditing.
- Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data to ensure it is accurate, complete and unbiased.
- Data augmentation: Use data augmentation techniques to generate new instances of underrepresented groups.
- Regular auditing: Regularly audit the dataset to ensure it remains balanced and fair.
