Generative AI is powered by models that are pretrained on internet-scale data, and these models are called foundation models (FMs). Â With FMs, instead of gathering labeled data for each model and training multiple models as in traditional ML, you can adapt a single FM to perform multiple tasks.
FMs can also serve as the starting point for developing more specialized models.

### Foundation Model lifecycle
The foundation model lifecycle is a comprehensive process that involves several stages, each playing a crucial role in developing and deploying effective and reliable foundation models.

1. **Data Selection**: Unlabeled data can be used at scale for pre-training because it is much easier to obtain compared to labeled data. Unlabeled data includes raw data, such as images, text files, or videos, with no meaningful informative labels to provide context. FMs require training on massive datasets from diverse sources.
2. **Pre-training**: Although traditional ML models rely on supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning patterns, FMs are typically pre-trained through self-supervised learning. With self-supervised learning, labeled examples are not required. Self-supervised learning makes use of the structure within the data to autogenerate labels. After the initial pre-training, the model can be further pre-trained on additional data. This is known as **continuous pre-training**.
3. **Optimization**: Pre-trained language models can be optimized through techniques like prompt-engineering, RAG and fine-tuning. 
4. **Evaluation**: the next step is to evaluate the model. An FM's performance can be measured using appropriate metrics and benchmarks.
5. **Deployment**: When the FM meets the desired performance criteria, it can be deployed in the target production environment. Deployment can involve integrating the model into applications, APIs, etc...
6. **Feedback and continuos improvement**: After deployment, the model's performance is continuously monitored, and feedback is collected from users, domain experts, or other stakeholders. This feedback, along with model monitoring data, is used to identify areas for improvement, detect potential biases or drift, and inform future iterations of the model.

## Essentials FMs

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large language models (LLMs) can be based on a variety of architectures, but the most common architecture in today's state-of-the-art models is the **transformer architecture**. Transformer-based LLMs are powerful models that can understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, and other sources, and learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases.

To better understand how LLMs work, let's talk about Tokens, Embeddings and Vectors. 

#### Tokens
Tokens are the basic units of text that the model processes. Tokens can be words, phrases, or individual characters like a period. Tokens also provide standardization of input data, which makes it easier for the model to process.

#### Embeddings and Vectors
Embeddings are numerical representations of tokens, where each token is assigned a vector (a list of numbers) that captures its meaning and relationships with other tokens. These vectors are learned during the training process and allow the model to understand the context and nuances of language.

### Diffusion Models
Diffusion is a deep learning architecture system that starts with pure noise and random data. The models gradually add more and more meaningful information to this noise until they end up with a clear and coherent output, like an image or a piece of text. Diffusion models learn through a two-step process of **forward diffusion** and **reverse diffusion**.
