The stack starts at the ML frameworks layer. At the core of this layer is **Amazon SageMaker**. SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service that you can use to build, train, and deploy your own custom models.

Next is the AI/ML services layer, where you find a wide array of specialized services tailored for different use cases.
Below most common. 

### Text and Documents domain
- Amazon Comprehend: natural language processing
- Amazon Translate: language translation
- Amazon Textract: extract data from scanned documents
### Chatbots domain
- Amazon Lex: to build conversational interfaces powered by the same deep learning technologies that drive Amazon Alexa.
### Speech domain
