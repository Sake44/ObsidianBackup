Generative AI is a subset of deep learning. It can adapt models that are built using deep learning without needing to retrain or fine-tune them.
Generative AI can automate tedious tasks such as data entry and analyze data to identify patterns and trends, which can assist organizations in making more informed decisions. Additionally, it can automate complex tasks, freeing up time for users to focus on more creative work.
### GenAI capabilities
1. Adaptability: Generative AI models can adapt to various tasks and domains by learning from data and generating content tailored to specific contexts or requirements.
2. Responsiveness: Generative AI models can generate content in real-time, which results in rapid response times and dynamic interactions.
3. Simplicity: Generative AI can simplify complex tasks by automating content creation processes. For example, AI language models can generate human-like text, which reduces the time and effort required for content generation.
4. Creativity and exploration: Generative AI models can generate novel ideas, designs, or solutions by combining and recombining elements in unique ways.
5. Data efficiency: Some generative AI models can learn from relatively small amounts of data and generate new samples consistent with the training data.
6. Personalization: Generative AI can create personalized content tailored to individual preferences or characteristics, which enhances user experiences and engagement.
7. Scalability: When trained, generative AI models can generate large amounts of content quickly. This makes the models suitable for tasks that require producing content at scale.

Models are optimized for different tasks, so choosing the right one is crucial for achieving the desired results.
Some of the key factors to consider when selecting an appropriate generative AI model include the following:Â 
- Model types: there are several models to choose based on the use case we want to satisfy.
- Performance requirements: Performance requirements are another factor to consider when selecting a generative AI model. These requirements include accuracy, reliability of the output, and others.
- Capabilities: Another factor to consider is the model's capabilities. Generative AI encompasses a wide range of capabilities. It can perform different tasks with varying degrees of output quality and levels of control or customization.
- Constraints
- Compliance
- Cost: another key factor is cost. GenAI models can vary in terms of cost. Larger models are usually more precise, but they are expensive and offer few deployment options.
