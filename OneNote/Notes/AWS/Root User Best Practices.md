The root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources in your account, including your billing and personal information.
 
To ensure the safety of the root user, follow these best practices:
 - Choose a strong password for the root user.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user.
- Never share your root user password or access keys with anyone.
- Disable or delete the access keys associated with the root user.
- Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user for administrative tasks or everyday tasks.
