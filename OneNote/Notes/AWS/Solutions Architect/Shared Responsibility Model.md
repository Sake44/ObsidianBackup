AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. This means that AWS protects and secures the infrastructure that runs the services offered in the AWS Cloud. AWS is responsible for the following:

- Protecting and securing AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and data centers, down to the physical security of the buildings
- Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the physical servers, host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components

Customers are responsible for security in the cloud. When using any AWS service, the customer is responsible for properly configuring the service and their applications, in addition to ensuring that their data is secure.  
AWS has published service-level-agreements (SLAs) for most AWS cloud services.  
Current details on the SLAs offered by AWS can be viewed at  
[SLAs](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/service-level-agreements). AWS defines its commitments in each SLA about security, compliance, and overall operations. The challenge is to live up to these agreements when all services fail from time to time. Each cloud service SLA contains details about the acceptable outage times and the responsibilityof the cloud provider when outages occur. Each SLA also contains statements about their level of responsibility for events outside the cloud provider’s control. SLAs commonly use terms such as “best effort” and “commercially reasonable effort.”
