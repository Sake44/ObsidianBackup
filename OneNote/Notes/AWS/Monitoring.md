**Use metrics to solve problems**  
The AWS resources that host your solutions create various forms of data that you might be interested in collecting. Each individual data point that a resource creates is a metric. Metrics that are collected and analyzed over time become statistics, such as average CPU utilization over time showing a spike.

**Monitoring benefits**
 
**Respond proactively**
 
**Respond to operational issues proactively before your end users are aware of them.** Waiting for end users to let you know when your application is experiencing an outage is a bad practice. Through monitoring, you can keep tabs on metrics like error response rate and request latency.
 
**Improve performance and reliability**
 
**Monitoring can improve the performance and reliability of your resources.** Monitoring the various resources that comprise your application provides you with a full picture of how your solution behaves as a system. Monitoring, if done well, can illuminate bottlenecks and inefficient architectures. This helps you drive performance and improve reliability.
 
**Recognize security threats and events**
 
**By monitoring, you can recognize security threats and events.** When you monitor resources, events, and systems over time, you create what is called a baseline. A baseline defines normal activity.

**Make data-driven decisions**
 
**Monitoring helps you make data-driven decisions for your business.** Monitoring keeps an eye on IT operational health and drives business decisions.

**Create cost-effective solutions**
 
**Through monitoring, you can create more cost-effective solutions.** You can view resources that are underused and rightsize your resources to your usage. This helps you optimize cost and make sure you aren’t spending more money than necessary.
