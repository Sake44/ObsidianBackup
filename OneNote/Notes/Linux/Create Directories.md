To create a directory:

```
mkdir <directory name>
```

We can add multiple names for each directory we want.

**mkdir** will not create by default sub directories, so a command like:

```
mkdir /dir1/dir2
```

will return an output. To create sub directories we can:

```
mkdir -p dir/dir1/dir2
```

Let's see how to create a file. (See [Create Files](Create%20Files.md))
