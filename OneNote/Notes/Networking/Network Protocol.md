A network protocol is similar to a human protocol, except that the entities exchanging messages and taking actions are hardware or software components of some device.
All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

> A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two
   or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission
   and/or receipt of a message or other event.

## The network edge
Recall from the previous section that in computer networking jargon, the computers and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as **end system**. Below an image of end system interaction:

End systems are also referred to as **hosts** because they host (that is, run) application programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail client program.
Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers. 
Informally, clients tend to be desktops, laptops, smartphones, and so on, whereas
servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages,
stream video, relay e-mail, and so on.

### Access Network
Having considered the applications and end systems at the “edge of the network,” let’s next consider the access network—the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.

#### Home access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, and 5G Fixed Wireless
The two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable. A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access.
