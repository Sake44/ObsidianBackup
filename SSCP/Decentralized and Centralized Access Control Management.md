**Decentralized**  
==System administrators and the local area network (LAN) administrator originally handled all access control locally. When a user needed access, the manager had to request access from the local IT staff, who would then arrange that accessâ€”but often days later. This was an inefficient process, but since each system and each LAN operated as a separate entity in the early days, it was really the only way to manage access.==
 
**Centralized**  
==Many organizations have migrated to a centralized access control framework, and this has many advantages.==  
**Because a centralized department oversees the access for all staff, regardless of work location, access is consistently managed.**  
==Defined procedures can be set up to ensure access is granted in compliance with centrally defined policies, privacy laws, and standards. This avoids problems with decentralized access management, where various local managers approach access control their own way, inconsistently and unpredictably.==
