**Internet**
 
The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the standard internet protocol suite (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP) to link billions of devices worldwide. It encompasses millions of private, public, academic, business and government packet switched networks, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
 
**Intranet**  
==An intranet is a network based on TCP/IP protocols (an internet) belonging to an organization, usually a corporation, accessible only by the organization’s members, employees, or others with authorization. Intranets utilize standard network hardware and software technologies such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, TCP/IP, web browsers, and web servers. An organization’s intranet typically includes internet access but is firewalled so that its computers cannot be reached directly from the outside.==
   

**DMZ**  
==A DMZ is a network architecture or segment that sits between an organization’s internal network, such as an intranet, and an external network, typically the internet, as shown in the figure. It acts as a buffer zone, separating the internal network from external, untrusted networks,== ==which allows organizations to enforce stricter security measures and control access to sensitive data and services.==

**The purpose of a DMZ is to enhance network security by providing a controlled environment for hosting services that need to be accessible from the internet while minimizing the risk to internal resources and systems.**
