Identity and access management (IAM) systems include the technologies, systems, and protocols that automate and streamline creating, provisioning, sharing, authenticating, and updating the identities and related information for users and entities.
 
**IAM Process**  
==As a process, IAM consists of three entities:==

- ==Claimant or user==
- ==Requesting system==Â 
- ==Authenticating system== 
==The user, by attempting to log on to a system, claims to be the identity whose ID and other information was presented. That system requests that the authentication system confirm or deny the validity of that claimed identity.==
   

**Central to the concept of IAM systems is the distinction between an identity and a credential.**  
==An identity is the unique representation of an individual, device, or entity within a system. It represents who or what the user or entity is and is used to establish a unique presence in the system.==
 
A credential, in contrast, is the piece of evidence or data used to verify the identity of a user or entity. It provides proof that the claimed identity is valid and authorized to access the system and is what the system uses to authenticate the identity.
