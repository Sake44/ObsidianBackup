**Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is a security model that determines access rights based on attributes associated with users, resources, and environmental conditions.**  
==In ABAC, access decisions are made dynamically at runtime by evaluating the attributes of the requesting user, the resource being accessed, and the context of the access attempt against a set of access control policies.==  
==It uses attributes such as user roles, group memberships, user attributes (e.g., department, job title), resource properties (e.g., sensitivity level, classification), and environmental factors (e.g., time of day, location) to define access control policies.==
 
ABAC is a centralized implementation of rule-based access control (RuBAC).
