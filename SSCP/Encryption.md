**Symmetric encryption**
 
   
uses the same key to encrypt the plaintext and decrypt the ciphertext.
 
- Fast
- Use less processing
- Preferred
 
The problem is that anyone has the key can decrypt the message.  
Key exchange must be secure which can be diffucult.
 
Symmetric Algorithms
 
- Data Encryption Standard (DES): old, 56 bit key, not secure.
- 3DES - triples DES
- Twofish - fast, 128bits
- RC4 - use in older wireless and SSL       

Hashing:
 
One way encryption not intended to be decrypted.  
Hashing supports integrity.
 
A hash canbnot be reversed back to the item that was hashed.  
Fixed length output: the number generated by the hash is always the same length.
 
**Asymmetric Encryption**
 
asymmetric uses one key to encrypt the plaintext and   
a different key to decrypt the ciphertext.
 
Public key: can be released to anyone.  
Private key: must be kept private.
 
No issue with exchanging keys.  
Provides accountability. The identity of the partners can be verified.
 
Not fast as symmetric.
 
Certificates support asymmetric encryption. Certificate is a signed copy of the public key.
