**Subject-based access control (SBAC) restricts access based on the user attributes, while object-based access control (OBAC) restricts access based on the object attributes.**  
**Subject-Based Access Control**  
==SBAC is a model that determines access to resources based on the attributes or characteristics of the user (subject). In SBAC, access decisions are made by evaluating the attributes associated with the user attempting to access the resource.==  
Access decisions in SBAC are based on policies that specify which attributes are required to access a resource and the conditions under which access is to be granted or denied. These policies are typically defined and enforced by access control mechanisms, such as access control lists (ACLs), authorization rules, or attribute-based access control (ABAC) engines.
   

**O****bject-Based Access Control**  
==OBAC is a model that determines access to resources based on the attributes or characteristics of the resource (object) being sought or accessed. These attributes might include the type of resource, its classification, sensitivity level, ownership, location or any other relevant object-specific characteristics or metadata.==
