**Change Management** ==- Planning and implementing changes to avoid business disruption such as failure of systems, loss of functionality, introduction of security vulnerabilities or compromise of data integrity may be compromised.==
 
**Classification** ==- The process of recognizing the impacts to the organization if its information suffers any security compromise—to its confidentiality-, integrity-, availability-, non-repudiation-, authenticity-, privacy-, or safety-related characteristics. Classifications are derived from the compliance mandates the organization must operate within, whether these be law, regulation, contract-specified standards, or other business expectations.==
 
**Compensating Controls** ==- Introduced when a system's existing capabilities do not support a policy's requirements.==
 
**Confidentiality** ==- Refers to the property of information in which it is only made available to those who have a legitimate need to know.==
 
**Configuration Control (CC)**==- Process of controlling modifications to hardware, firmware, software, and documentation to protect the information system against improper modifications prior to, during, and after system implementation. Source: NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1==
 
**Configuration Item (CI)**==- 1) An aggregation of information system components that is designated for configuration management and treated as a single entity in the configuration management process. Source: NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4. 2) Item or aggregation of hardware, software, or both, which is designated for configuration management and treated as a single entity in the configuration management process. Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288==
 
**Configuration Management (CM)** ==- A collection of activities focused on establishing and maintaining the integrity of information technology products and information systems, through control of processes for initializing, changing, and monitoring the configurations of those products and systems throughout the system development life cycle. Source: NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4==
 
**Corrective Controls** ==- These controls remedy the circumstances that enabled unwarranted activity and/or return conditions to where they were prior to the unwanted activity.==
 
**Covert Channel** ==- Hidden use of bandwidth or storage to communicate or hide a message.==  
**Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)** ==- An architectural approach to the design of buildings and spaces which emphasizes passive features to reduce the likelihood of criminal activity.==
 
**Defense in Depth** ==- Provision of several overlapping subsequent limiting barriers with no respect to one safety or security threshold, so that the threshold can only be surpassed if all barriers have failed.==
 
**Deterrent Controls** ==- Controls that prescribe some sort of punishment, ranging from embarrassment to job termination or jail time for noncompliance. Their intent is to dissuade people from performing unwanted acts.==
 
**DevSecOps** ==- Provides for a merger of phased review (as in the waterfall Security Development Life Cycle with the DevOps method, to incorporate the needs for security, safety, resilience, or other emerging properties in the final system, at each turn of the cycle of development.==
 
**Directive Controls** ==- Controls dictated by organizational and legal authorities.==
 
**Early Smoke Detection Apparatus (VESDA)** ==- Air sampling devices; the name is a trademark of Xtralis.==  
**Integrity** ==- The property of information whereby it is recorded, used, and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency, and usefulness for a stated purpose.==
 
**Interface** ==- Common boundary between independent systems or modules where interactions take place. Source: CNSSI 4009==
 
**IT Asset Management (ITAM)** ==- Entails collecting inventory and financial and contractual data to manage the IT asset throughout its life cycle.==
 
**Least Privilege** ==- A security principle in which any user or process is given only the necessary, minimum level of access rights (privileges) explicitly, for the minimum amount of time, for it to complete its operation.==
 
**Non-Repudiation** ==- A service that is used to provide assurance of the integrity and origin of data in such a way that the integrity and origin can be verified by a third party as having originated from a specific entity in possession of the private key of the claimed signatory.==
 
**Patch Management**==- Monitoring and periodically updating software and hardware devices that are subject to modification.==
 
**Phishing** ==- The attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money) by masquerading as a trustworthy entity, typically over email.==
 
**Physical Controls** ==- Controls implemented through a tangible mechanism. Examples include walls, fences, guards, locks, and so forth. In modern organizations, many physical control systems are linked to technical/logical systems, such as badge readers connected to door locks.==
 
**Preventive Controls -**==Controls that prohibit unwanted actions.==
 
**Privacy** ==- The rights and obligations of individuals and organizations with respect to the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal information.==
 
**Reactive Controls** ==- Also known as corrective controls. See corrective controls.==
 
**Safeguard** ==- A built-in proactive security control implemented to provide protection against threats.==
 
**Separation of Duties** ==- An operational security mechanism for preventing fraud and unauthorized use that requires two or more individuals to complete a task or perform a specific function.==
 
**Social Engineering** ==- Methods that bad actors can use to trick users or con them into engaging in behavior in which they would not normally engage.==
 
**Technical Controls** ==- The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an information system are primarily implemented and executed by the information system through mechanisms contained in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system.==
 
**Threat** ==- A human actor or group, which makes the deliberate, intentional decision to exploit (or make use of) a target organization’s systems vulnerabilities, as part of achieving or furthering the threat’s own goals or objectives.==
 
**Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)** ==- A battery backup system that maintains a continuous supply of electric power to connected equipment by supplying power from a separate source when utility power is not available.==
 
**Vulnerability** ==- A weakness or flaw in a system, application, network, process. Policy or procedure that could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the system or to cause harm.==
