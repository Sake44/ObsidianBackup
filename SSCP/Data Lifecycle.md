**Creation comes first and destruction last, but the intervening actions happen repeatedly, in any order, to meet the needs of data users.**

- _Creation._ ==Creation is the generation or acquisition of new content, or the iteration or updating of existing content. The data owner will classify the data depending on its sensitivity and criticality at the point of creation or when they are brought into the organization. This must be done carefully, as the selection of security controls and protection resources will be based on this classification.==
- _Storing or recording._ ==When data is created, it is temporarily stored in volatile memory, including registers, cache, and random-access memory (RAM). It may also be committed to storage on solid state drives (SSDs), hybrid hard drives (HDDs), storage area networks (SANs), network attached storage (NAS), external drives, thumb drives, and—of course—in the cloud. Storing is the process of committing the data to a storage medium. Data in storage should be protected in accordance with its classification and categorization levels as well as baseline controls like encryption, access controls, logging, monitoring, and redundancy.==
- _Use._ ==Data is accessed, viewed, processed, or used. This is when data is most vulnerable, because it is decrypted and made into cleartext. Data is also at risk if it can be copied or extracted. Controls such as data loss prevention (DLP), digital rights management (DRM), and access controls should be in place to protect data in use from unauthorized access or alteration.== 
- _Sharing._ ==Information is shared between users, or with customers, partners, vendors, and other third parties. Not all data should be shared, and not all sharing should present a threat, but because data shared externally is no longer under control, maintaining security can be difficult. Data should only be shared if its classification indicates that it will be safe, then only with authorized persons. Technologies, such as DLP, can be used to detect unauthorized sharing.== 
- _Archiving._ ==Data leaving active use may require long-term storage. Archiving data for a long period can be challenging, especially from a security perspective. For example, considerations of security through the archive period may affect data access procedures. The storage technology used may present challenges as well. What if data is stored on a specific medium and needs to be retrieved several years later? Will technology still exist to read the media? Data placed in archives must continue to be protected according to its classification level.Legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to archived data must also be addressed.==
- _Disposal._ ==Disposal considers the data sensitivity at the time of disposal. Data that is not sensitive and devices that have not held sensitive data can simply be discarded or recycled, whereas data that is still sensitive and media that have held sensitive data must be securely destroyed.==
