**A****ctive Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is a software component developed by Microsoft and an implementation of a federated identity management (FIM) system.**  
==The FIM system enables sharing of identity information and authentication processes across different security domains, enabling secure access to applications and services both within and between organizations, which are known as federated partners. This is particularly useful for businesses that need to collaborate securely across different domains. ADFS leverages claims-based authentication, where claims (key/value pairs representing user information) are used for authentication and authorization decisions.==

==Key features of ADFS include:==

- _Single sign-on (SSO)._ ==This enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to reenter credentials.==
- _Federated identity._ ==This allows organizations to establish trust relationships with other organizations, enabling users to access resources across different domains securely.==
- _Claims-based authentication._ ==This uses claims (key/value pairs that represent information about the user) for authentication and authorization decisions.==
- _Security token service (STS)._ ==STS issues security tokens that applications use to grant access based on the claims included in the token.==
- _Integration with active directory._ ==This seamlessly integrates with existing Active Directory (AD) infrastructure, leveraging existing user accounts and groups.==
