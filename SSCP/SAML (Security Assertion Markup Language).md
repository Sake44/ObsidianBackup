==SAML uses the extensible markup language-based (XML) framework for describing and exchanging security information. The security information is maintained in SAML assertions that work between trusted security domain boundaries, particularly between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).==  
==SAML components include:==

- _Assumptions._ ==These define how SAML attributes, authentication, and authorization requests-response protocol messages can be exchanged between systems using common underlying communication protocols and frameworks.==
- _Bindings._ ==These define how SAML assertions and protocols message exchanges are conducted with response/request pairs.==
- _Protocols._ ==These define what protocols are used, including HTTP and Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP).==
- _Profiles._ ==These define specific sets of rules for a use case for attributes, bindings, and protocols for a SAML session.==
