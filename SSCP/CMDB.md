**Configuration management databases (CMDBs)store detailed information used for tracking and managing assets.**  
==The CMDB helps keep track of information, such as make, model, serial number, asset type number, and version number. A CMDB also provides a restoration point should there be a need, for example, to rebuild a user’s laptop to the correct version, including hardware and software.==
   

**Information Asset Ownership**  
==An important part of the process of building and maintaining an information asset inventory is identifying a responsible person or organization as that asset’s owner. An asset owner is best defined as the person or organizational unit with the primary responsibility for setting the required information security and quality guidelines, policies, or requirements for that asset. The asset owner provides a single authoritative voice for security and data quality standards and practices that should be applied to or used with that asset.==

==Data owners must carefully consider the following:==

- _Data classification and categorization._ ==Define the criteria and processes used to determine the required levels of information security protection. These should include policies and criteria for reviewing and changing the levels of classification and categorization, if required, throughout the life cycle of that data asset.== 
- _Data access._ ==Define the roles of people who can access the data.== 
- _Data security._ ==Determine whether the data is generally available or restricted by default. For example, many companies set access controls to deny database access to everyone except those who are specifically granted permission to view or update the data.== 
- _Data retention._ ==Many industries require that data be retained for a certain time. Many financial regulations worldwide require retention periods. Asset owners should know the regulatory requirements for their data.==
- _Data disposal._ ==Data classification and categorization directly influence the method in which the data is to be disposed.== 
- _Data encryption._ ==Data owners must decide which data should be encrypted and how. Data encryption will often be required to meet specific legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements.== 
- _Appropriate use of data._ ==This portion of the policy defines whether data is for use within the company, is restricted for use by only selected roles, or can be made public.==

**Data Sensitivity Levels and Labels**  
==Sensitivity levels and labels capture in one or two words a simple, easy-to-recognize warning statement as to possible harm to the organization if the data is compromised. Data sensitivity can embrace both classification (impact or loss) and categorization (grouping based on impacts or compliance needs) concerns. From highest to lowest, the following represents a typical set of sensitivity levels:==

- _Highly restricted._ ==Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could possibly put the organization’s existence at risk. Compromise could lead to loss of life, injury, property damage, and the litigation and claims that would follow.== 
- _Moderately restricted._ ==Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could lead to loss of temporary competitive advantage, loss of revenues, or disruption of planned investments or activities.== 
- _Low sensitivity/internal-use only._ ==Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could cause minor disruptions, delays, or impacts.==
- _Unrestricted public data._ ==No harm can come from dissemination or disclosure.==

==The Center for Internet Security, on the other hand, offers only three different labels: sensitive, business confidential, and public.==  
==Data categorization levels often reflect the source or nature of the security requirements that dictate their use. Unlike sensitivity classifications, these often do not fit neatly onto a hierarchy of most to least damaging:==

- _Human safety critical._ ==Information which, if compromised, could cause loss of life or injury.== 
- _Equipment and property safety critical._ ==Information which, if compromised, could lead to physical property or systems being damaged.== 
- _Personally identifiable information (PII) critical._ ==Information that can be used to uniquely identify a particular person.== 
- _Private data._ ==Information that the organization has agreed to keep private or of which to limit distribution, dissemination, and use.== 
- _Proprietary data._ ==Information regarding the organization’s internal business logic, processes, decisions, or criteria for decision making.== 
- _Compliance data._==Any data that has special handling and protection requirements defined by law, regulation, or contract.== 
- _Time-critical data._ ==Information which, if compromised or delayed, could cause a significant business or organizational activity to fail or be cancelled or postponed.==
