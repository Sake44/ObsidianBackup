**Discretionary access control (DAC) is a security model in which the owner of the resource grants or denies access to users or entities on objects such as a file or a directory.**  
==Although access is entirely at the discretion of the owner, owners typically assign different permissions to different users or groups based on their roles, responsibilities, or relationships with the resource owner.==  
**DAC provides flexibility and granularity, allowing resource owners to specify fine-grained access permissions for individual users or groups.**  
==DAC typically relies on access control lists (ACLs) to manage access permissions. Here, the ACL is a list of permissions associated with an object (e.g., file, directory, or resource) that specifies which users or groups are granted specific types of access (e.g., read, write, execute) to the object. The owner can modify the ACL associated with the resource to change access permissions, add or remove users or groups, or delegate ownership rights.==
