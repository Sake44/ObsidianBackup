==Kerberos uses symmetric encryption to encrypt the exchange of messages among users, key distribution centers (KDC), and applications. This provides confidentiality of the communications but does not protect against other forms of attack, such as a brute force on the passwords or compromise of the data stored in the KDC.==  
**Kerberos is designed to provide strong authentication using symmetric cryptography.**

**Kerberos Applications**  
==Kerberos is based on a centralized architecture, thereby reducing administrative effort in managing all authentications from a single server. Furthermore, the use of Kerberos provides support for the following:==

- _Authentication._ ==Users are who they claim to be.==
- _Confidentiality._ ==Data is kept secret.==
- _Integrity._ ==Data received is the same as the data sent.==

**Kerberos requires that all devices on the network use Kerberos to communicate, and if the KDC is unavailable, then no one can communicate.**
 
**Kerberos Considerations**  
==To provide for the successful implementation and operation of Kerberos, the following should be considered:==

- ==Overall security depends on careful implementation.==
- ==Trusted and synchronized clocks across the enterprise network are required.==
- ==Enforcing limited lifetimes for authentication based on time stamps reduces the threat of a malicious attacker gaining unauthorized access using fraudulent credentials.==
- ==The key distribution center must be physically secure.==
- ==The key distribution center must be isolated on the network and should not participate in any non-Kerberos network activity.==
- ==The AS can be a critical single point of failure.==
 
Kerberos Tools

- _Kerbtray.exe._ ==Kerberos Tray displays ticket information via a GUI. It allows a user to view and purge the ticket cache.==
- _Klist.exe._==Kerberos List is a command-line tool that is used to view and delete Kerberos tickets granted to the current logon session. To use Kerberos List to view tickets, a user must run the tool on a computer that is a member of a Kerberos realm. When a Kerberos List is run from a client, it shows the following:==
    
    - ==Ticket-granting ticket (TGT) to a Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) in Windows== 
    - ==Ticket-granting ticket (TGT) to Kserver on UNIX==

_Ksetup.exe._ ==Kerberos Setup is a command-line tool that can be used to configure Kerberos interoperability. Including, but not limited to:==

- ==Set up local account to Kerberos V5 account mappings.==
- ==Set the computer’s password in the Kerberos realm.==
- ==Change a user’s password in a Kerberos V5 realm.==
