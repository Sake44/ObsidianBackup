**The security kernel is the core part of the operating system responsible for enforcing security mechanisms by implementing access controls, managing security policies, and ensuring system integrity.**  
**The security kernel acts as the gatekeeper for all interactions between the hardware, software, and users, providing a secure environment for executing operations.**  
==The security kernel is the practical implementation of the reference monitor within the trusted computing base (TCB).== 
 
==The security kernel provides:==

- _Access controls._ ==The security kernel ensures that users and programs can only access resources they are authorized to use.==
- _Audit._ ==The security kernel keeps records of access attempts and actions for monitoring and identifying security breaches.==
- _Integrity._ ==The security kernel protects itself as well as the system from unauthorized modifications.==   

==Features of the security kernel include:==

- _Modularity._ ==The security kernel consists of well-defined, independent modules to enhance security and manageability.==
- _Isolation._ ==The security kernel separates security functions from other system functions to prevent unauthorized access.==
- _Fault tolerance._ ==The security kernel includes mechanisms to continue operating correctly even if parts of the system fail.==
    
**The trusted computing base (TCB) has a security kernel architecture that implements the reference monitor concept to enforce access control policies.**  
==Together, the TCB, security kernel, and reference monitor concept validate access to objectives by authorized subjects:==

- _The TCB and reference monitor._ ==The TCB includes the reference monitor. Its design principles guide the construction of the TCB to ensure all access to resources is controlled and mediated according to security policies.== 
- _Reference monitor and security kernel._ ==The security kernel implements the reference monitor’s principles, providing robust and secure mechanisms to enforce access controls and protect system integrity.==
- _The TCB and security kernel._ ==The TCB includes the security kernel, which serves as the trusted component of the operating system responsible for enforcing security policies. The security kernel’s effectiveness directly impacts the overall security provided by the TCB.==
