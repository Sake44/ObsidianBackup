**The asset management lifecycle is a comprehensive framework designed to manage and protect an organizationâ€™s digital and physical assets throughout their operational lives.**  
==By following the asset management lifecycle, security professionals ensure that assets are used efficiently while safeguarding them against various cyber threats.==  
==The first step in the asset management life cycle involves identifying and categorizing all assets within the organization, including hardware, software, and data.==
 
Once all assets have been identified, they are added to an information asset inventory, which is usually organized by the business processes that the assets are involved with or support.
 
Next, assets must be classified based on their criticality and sensitivity. These classifications will help prioritize security efforts, so that organizations can focus resources on protecting the most critical and most sensitive assets first.
 
With a clear understanding of what assets exist and their associated risks, organizations can then establish control mechanisms to manage these assets. This includes defining access controls, implementing security policies, and establishing usage guidelines.  
Protective measures are then applied to safeguard the assets. This encompasses a range of security strategies such as the installation of antivirus software, firewalls, IDS/IPS, and encryption protocols for data protection. Regular security updates and patches are applied to counteract emerging threats.  
Organizations must then continuously monitor their assets to promptly detect and respond to security incidents and any abnormal activities that could indicate a security breach.
