# IT Repo
This repo was intended as Obsidian Backup since I use it to take notes. The most recent addition use **Markdown** language to edit file, so any addition is suggested to be in the same language. The oldest files are exported from some other notes tools, so not in Markdown. I taught to make it public since someone can find it helpful.

This repo contains a summary of LPIC-101 and LPIC-102. This resources are useful for Linux Certification. Link: [LPIC-1 Exam 101 and 102 Objectives - Linux Professional Institute (LPI)](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-101-102-objectives/)
