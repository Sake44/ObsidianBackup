# IT Repo
This repo was intended as Obsidian Backup since I use it to take notes. The most recent addition use **Markdown** language to edit file, so any addition is suggested to be in the same language. The oldest files are exported from some other notes tools, so not in Markdown. I taught to make it public since someone can find it helpful.
